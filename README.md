# Agent Bot Gateway
The Agent Bot Gateway allows connecting customers over the [Chatwoot](chatwoot.com) Omni-channel CRM to
so called agent bots. An agent bot is a chatbot that acts as a customer support agent in Chatwoot.

It has been developed as part of my master thesis at Saarland University. In this repo I will also try to make
my originally private implementation more generalizable if possible. However, it will be primarily be targeted to
the needs for my master thesis that I am currently actively working on. I am releasing the components of the
Conversational User Interface that I am building for my master thesis under MIT license.

The implementation currently provides the implementations for an Echo Agent Bot and one that implements a custom
Rasa integration.
